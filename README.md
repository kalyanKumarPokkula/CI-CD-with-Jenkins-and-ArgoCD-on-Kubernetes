# Automated Deployment Orchestrated: CI/CD with Jenkins and ArgoCD on Kubernetes

This CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) setup utilizes Jenkins and ArgoCD within a Kubernetes environment to streamline and automate the deployment process.

Jenkins serves as the CI component, facilitating automated builds, tests, and code integration from the source code repository. It ensures that code changes are continuously validated and integrated into the project.

ArgoCD, on the other hand, manages the CD aspect, orchestrating the deployment of applications to Kubernetes clusters. It automates the rollout process, ensuring consistency and reliability across environments.

Together, Jenkins and ArgoCD form a robust pipeline that automates the entire software delivery lifecycle, from code changes to deployment, providing efficiency, consistency, and reliability in the deployment process.
